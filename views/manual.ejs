            <p>Welcome to the Typing Trainer! This platform helps you improve your typing speed and accuracy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Navigate to the 'Practice' section to start typing exercises. Select a text and begin typing in the input area. Your speed (WPM), accuracy, and errors will be tracked in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile:</strong> Visit your 'Profile' page (available when logged in) to see your overall statistics (like average WPM, accuracy, total time practiced), progress charts, and view your purchased items on the 'Shelf' tab.</li>
                <li><strong>Texts:</strong> Browse available texts for practice in the 'Texts' section. Logged-in users can add, edit, categorize, and upload their own texts (including PDFs).</li>
